          We are NovaCrafters, a 501(c)(3) nonprofit founded by two brothers passionate about design, development, and community service. Our mission is to design, develop, and update websites for other nonprofits — entirely free of charge.
        </p>
        <p>
          You might wonder why we do this. It’s simple: we believe a strong digital presence can help amplify a nonprofit’s voice and impact. By offering professional web design services at no cost, we aim to help smaller organizations reach a broader audience and achieve their missions.
        </p>
        <p>
          Over the years, we’ve won multiple awards for our web development work and completed dozens of projects. Our dedication to both technology and community allows us to support organizations doing good — while doing what we love.
